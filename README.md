# SEP10 Freedom Project
by Fatjon Dungu

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of the medical field. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study the medical field in order to help me make by website.

## Content

 My product I have decided to made is three products and they are all in my website which is linked below. One is a device that can predict cancer cells, causing people to have more of a fighting chance against them. My second product are pills that fight addictions. My third product is a bed that alows nurses to move overweight patients without as much backpain. 

## Challanges of this and my takeaways

Making this website my main problem was procrastination and not having a plan
