                                <p>A possible idea for an invention is a device that predicts when someone is going to get any kind of cancer or tumor. Not just breast cancer
                                </p>
                                <p> At first it is going to be very big and take up alot of energy along with not being too much of the product.
                                    However  the it will get small, take up less space and electricity while still being accurate
                                   I intended to stop a horrible thing that takes countless lives before it happens and something like this already exists for breast cancer and tumors.
                              I also intend on it to be the size of a average X-Ray.

                            <p>I plan to make this pill even more addicting than the most addicting drugs at first  and is designed to make the drugs takes unbearable and someone will only take one per week to avoid overdosing and can only be get from a pharmacist with a prescription,

                                After a while the pill will begin to taste unbearable as well and will build up your ability to resist the addiction of drugs.
