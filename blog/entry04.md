## The tool I chose

 I decided to go with [A-frame](https://aframe.io/) because how simple and cool it was. Mr.muller, my teacher, also thought it was a good idea so i decided to roll with A-frame with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as a backup incase if I decided to chance my mind.

## Testing it

 I decided to first changes tehe sizes of the shapes to se how much options they are and how large and small are the shapes, Then I decided to go to the website to find if they are anymore shapes but then just decided to just stick with what I got. Then I decided to start deleting lines or parts on lines to see what each line or part of a line means, the just decided to scrool on the website again to see if I missed something. [Also reserched and see if they are anymore shapes and I got a ring.](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/geometry.html)
 

## The Results
 
 Below are the screenshots of the code after I tinkered with the code and learned how to put images from the last blog.
