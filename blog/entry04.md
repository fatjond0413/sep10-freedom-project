## The tool I chose

I decided to go with A-frame because how simple and cool it was. Mr.muller, my teacher, also thought it was a good idea so i decided to roll with A-frame with Bulma as a backup incase if I decided to chance my mind.

## Testing it

I decided to first changes tehe sizes of the shapes to se how much options they are and how large and small are the shapes, Then I decided to go to the website to find if they are anymore shapes but then just decided to just stick with what I got. Then I decided to start deleting lines or parts on lines to see what each line or part of a line means, the just decided to scrool on the website again to see if I missed something.
