Reserching technologies I have found in the medical field is that nearly eveything I though or were think was already invention. Even my first idea was invented for some cancers like breast cancer and more. They were also much more technologies in the medical file than I though as I found and things I did not even thing were medical technologies in this [website](https://www.proclinical.com/blogs/2022-4/top-10-new-medical-technologies-2022) and on the [web](https://www.google.com/search?q=list+of+technology+of+medical+field&sca_esv=594974358&rlz=1CAJYDF_enUS1025&ei=wF2TZci1E46x5NoP-dyj0Ao&ved=0ahUKEwjIlZ-Kvr2DAxWOGFkFHXnuCKoQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=list+of+technology+of+medical+field&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiI2xpc3Qgb2YgdGVjaG5vbG9neSBvZiBtZWRpY2FsIGZpZWxkMggQIRigARjDBDIIECEYoAEYwwRIsQ1QAFjPDHAAeACQAQCYAXagAc4EqgEDNy4xuAEDyAEA-AEBwgIIEAAYCBgHGB7CAgoQABgIGAcYHhgPwgIIEAAYCBgeGA3CAgsQABiABBiKBRiGA8ICBhAAGAgYHuIDBBgAIEGIBgE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&safe=active&ssui=on)
by just *"list of technologies in the medical field"*. I also reserched hardwares of medical field and it led me to this [site](https://www.futurehealthconcepts.com/blog/posts/10-pieces-of-medical-equipment-all-hospitals-need.html) and [here](https://www.netguru.com/blog/healthcare-software-types) when I search for softwares.
