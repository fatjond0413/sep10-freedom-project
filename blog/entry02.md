# Entry 2
##### 10/25/23

My backup plan for my first entry is being a engineer or mechanic because it is a very good paying job along with it being a job where there is also alot of oppertunities an many diffrent kinds of engineering jobs in the industry and I belive it is geniinly just a good plan c incase I don't make it in both fields.
