## The begining of making my MVP

 Before creating my MVP I first went and put the rubric or my MVP on the tab next to it. Then I went to my IDE and opened my MVP. Then I also went to [the bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/) and then got my containers to put my titles and content. But before starting I just checked the rubric and examples one last time before I decided to start my MVP to make sure I had a good idea of what  am doing for my MVP.

 
## Making my MVP and the challanges with it

  When creating my MVP I had abit of trouble remembring how to color my containers and other stuff like that and I couldn't find out where the code reveling hpw to di it was, then I remembered my old SHABAR project. So then I opened it and then looked at its code then I just took the code and put in into my MVP. Then I was just doing simple things like  puting Container Fluids and  for my major titles along Container at medium size for small titles along with puting the conrtainers in card bodies, I also  tried to focus one on task at a time and ignore the others so I have less stress to worry about.. Also since I do not know how to make diffrent containers diffrent colors I just decided to make them all the same. The I just did beginner level stuff like writing a paragrah and heading for my titles and content in the containers and even outside a card body for one paragrah. I tried to backa background images but I did not know how even when I went to websites like [this](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/fullscreen-background-image/#:~:text=You%20can%20easily%20set%20the,a%20link%20to%20our%20image.) as it did not turn out well. Then I made one big container that will fit all my content and then made a list. As I put my content in I notice a problem. That the images and text are not alligning well and are just stack on top of eachother. I honestly did not know how to fix this so I just let it be and learn how to for my beyond MVP. After a bit of  my code not going as plan and debugging my code along withptuing the rest of my content as well as a navabr, I know how to debug I finished my MVP most accurate to my wireframe as possible, turning in my MVP as a minimum viable product.

## Reflecting on my MVP and what to do better for my Beyond MVP

 This project truly made me realize on what [skills](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) I need to improve on like how to google or look  up stuff as if I did know how to do that I would had made a better MVP. I also needed to have a stronger memeory and learn more on how to do things like this insted of waiting until the last second to finish things incomplete or not as good as it should be. I also need to make some changes to the MVP itself like organizing it better and not having it stack on top of eachother. But I belive I did do got on some skills like problem decompoisition and embracing the fact that I have alot to improve in in both myself and my MVP.
