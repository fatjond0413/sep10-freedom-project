##Sep Expo Elevator Pitch

 Looking back on my elecator pitch in the expo I relized I made it to fast and did not really explain alot like explain if my websiyte is resposive, and while I did speak confidently about my website I caould have also been more informative. I belive that next time I should do an elevator pitch I should be much more informative and cut out unessisary things to say. I plan to do this one step at a time. Starting with a sentence and then moving up to take out more stuff and add more stuff.

 ## In-class presentation

 In class I realize I should have a plan when makiing my presentation so that I can give a much better showing. But before that I should stop procrastinating so that I have the time to make a plan first. To fight procrastination I plan to take several breaks during my work or when I am busy and then begin to shorten these breaks to help me get more focased on work along with starting my work soon in a slow and steady process instead of just trying do my work as soon as possible.
